# Connecting the Dots: Understanding Social Media Dynamics through Network Science

## Introduction
This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook (IPython notebook) for reproducing the visualizations presented in the blog post ["Connecting the Dots: Understanding Social Media Dynamics through Network Science."](https://medium.com/@patrishaanneestrada/connecting-the-dots-understanding-social-media-dynamics-through-network-science-7e51c2ec8e6)

## About the Blog Post

In the blog post, we explore the realm of information cascades and network science in the context of social media. We delve into various network visualization techniques, including bipartite graphs and their projections, to unravel the intricate structure of social networks. Additionally, we analyze essential network statistics, such as average shortest path length, clustering coefficient, and centrality measures, to gain deeper insights into information dissemination dynamics.
